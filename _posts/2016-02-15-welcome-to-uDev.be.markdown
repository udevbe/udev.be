The thought of starting a blog has been going through our heads for a few years
and the time has come to give in to it.
The main purpose of this blog would be to have a place where we can share
knowledge, experiences and the occasional brain fart.

Since we're great supporters of FOSS, everything we do with this website will be
done in the open.
You can check our [Github organization][1] and the [source][2] of our website.

Feel free to report any issues with this website on the [issue tracker][3]. We
even accept pull requests for (original) content.
