The main purpose of this blog would be to have a place where we can share
knowledge, experiences and the occasional brain fart.

Since we're great supporters of FOSS, everything we do with this website will be
done in the open.
You can check our Github organization [here]({{site.github.owner_url}}) and the
source of our website [here]({{site.github.repository_url}}).
